<!-- Brief description -->

_**`retext-spell` with `.respell` personal dictionary file support.**_

This package provides the exact same interface and functionality as
[`retext-spell`][retext-spell] with one small but useful modification.

1. **`retext-spell`** takes a **`personal`** option, which is a string of lines,
   in which each line is an entry in an [Hunspell][hunspell] **personal
   dictionary** (a.k.a. word list).

2. **`retext-spell-file`** also takes a `personal` option. But if that
   `personal` option is falsy, it will search up the directory hierarchy for a
   file named **`.respell`** and read its (UTF-8) contents into a value that is
   passed to `retext-spell` in the `personal` option.

4. Add one correctly spelled word per line to `.respell`.
